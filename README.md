## screen-capture
A simple screen capture program written in Java.


You can take new screenshots and draw on them with any size and color with left click and erase with right click. Middle click to select different color. Double click the image to insert text (doesn't work that well though)

You can also draw on a blank background or create a new background with selected width, height and color.

Currently only Imgur is supported.
